# JavaScript Quiz
## Description
This is a multiple choice quiz for those learning JavaScript or those wanting to test themselves to see how much they know.

The game is simple, you start with 45 seconds and gain a point for every correct answer. Every incorrect answer you lose 5 seconds. Once the timer hits 0 or there are no questions are left the game is over.

The player is able to enter their name at the end of the game to keep track of their scores.

In the future I plan on adding local storage so scores persist.
